# hello-world
practice
Waking up I see that everything is ok
The first time in my life
And now it's so great
Slowing down I look around
And I am so amazed
I think about the little things
That make life great
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
I found a place so safe
Not a single tear
The first time in my life
And now it's so clear
Feel calm my belong
I'm so happy here
It's so strong
And now I let myself be sincere
I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
It's the state of bliss you think
You're dreaming
It's the happiness inside
That you're feeling
It's so beautiful
It makes you wanna cry
It's the state of bliss you think
You're dreaming
It's the happiness inside
That you're feeling
It's so beautiful
It makes you wanna cry
It's so beautiful
It makes you want to cry

This innocence is brilliant
It makes you want to cry
This innocence is brilliant
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
This innocence is brilliant
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by
